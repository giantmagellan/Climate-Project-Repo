A hypothesis test is performed of the null hypothesis. The P-value turns out to be 3.325e-68. The result is statistically significant because the P-value is extremely small. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis. 

MAIN NULL HYPOTHESIS:  

- There is no relationship between sea level height and carbon dioxide.

MAIN ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS: 

- If there is an increase in carbon dioxide, then there is an increase in sea level height. 

METHODS: 

- Performed t-tests on 4 sets of independent samples
- Ran linear regression for each set of samples
- Obtained Pearson correlation coefficient to show strength of linear relationship.

DISCUSSION:

- Findings
- Potential methods 
- Compare multiple locations to find common trends
- Utilize other factors that could disprove the null hypothesis.

CONCLUSION: 

-
