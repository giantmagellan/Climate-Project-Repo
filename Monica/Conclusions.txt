MAIN NULL: 
There is no relationship between sea level height and carbon dioxide
ALTERNATE:
There is a relationship (increase) between carbon dioxide and sea level height.


Sea level null:
There is no relationship between mean sea level and tropospheric temperature
Sea level alternate:
There is a relationship between mean sea level and tropospheric temperature

Observations: 
There is a positive linear trend (with a slope of 0.002108130404272146) which
shows that there has been an increase in MSL during the past 100 years.
Mean sea level will most likely continue rising with this trend.
In the temperature figure, there has also been a positive linear trend
with a slope of 0.027635716440422304.
There is a possible correlation between MSL and tropospheric temperature 
as they are both positive with a p value of 5.484664954644351e-70
and 6.141113628698635e-185 respectively when individual ttests are performed.
Both are statistically significant. 


Further data needs to be explored because we cannot find a direct relationship
between the two factors.
