Null Hypothesis:
There is no correlation between CO2 levels and water temperatures. 
CO2 levels won't increase yearly by more than 0.5 PPM per year.

Observations:

Figure 1: CO2 levels have increased rapidly since 1970

T-test: T-test between CO2 and Water Temps returns a p-value of -4.69 which indicates a higher probability of proving wrong our null hypothesis that there is no correlation between the two.

Figure 2: Average CO2 levels and water temperatures have both risen over the years by a significant amount. The water temps are displayed as well as a poly line to show a more general trend. Since about 2010 the rate appears to have accelerated in water temperatures rising. 

Figure 3: Linear regression model shows general trend of CO2 levels.

Figure 4: Linear regression model also shows a general trend of water temperatures increasing. 

Figure 5: We plot our poly line vs linear regression model to further show that water temperatures have began to surpass the trend.

Total increase of averages from 1969 to 2018:
CO2:  83.086667
Surf_Temp: 2.413266

Average change:
Using list comprehension to calculate average change, we find that on average there was a 1.69(PPM)  increase in CO2 proving our other null hypothesis wrong.
