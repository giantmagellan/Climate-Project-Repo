Null Hypothesis:
There is no correlation between CO2 levels and water temperatures. 
CO2 levels won't increase yearly by more than 0.5 PPM per year.

Observations:

Figure 1: CO2 levels have increased rapidly since 1970

T-test: T-test between CO2 and Water Temps returns a p-value of -4.69 which indicates a higher probability of proving wrong our null hypothesis that there is no correlation between the two.

Figure 2: Average CO2 levels and water temperatures have both risen over the years by a significant amount. The water temps are displayed as well as a poly line to show a more general trend. Since about 2010 the rate appears to have accelerated in water temperatures rising. 

Figure 3: Linear regression model shows general trend of CO2 levels.

Figure 4: Linear regression model also shows a general trend of water temperatures increasing. 

Figure 5: We plot our poly line vs linear regression model to further show that water temperatures have began to surpass the trend.

Total increase of averages from 1969 to 2018:
CO2:  83.086667
Surf_Temp: 2.413266

Average change:
Using list comprehension to calculate average change, we find that on average there was a 1.69(PPM)  increase in CO2 proving our other null hypothesis wrong.

Conclusions:
The data shows a clear trend that CO2 levels have risen significantly and from the looks of it, will continue to rise. While the water temperatures have been volatile, our linear regression model still shows a trend of increasing temperatures. This is interesting when plotted alongside the rising CO2 levels. 

From this we can draw the conclusion that there is a possible correlation between CO2 and water temperatures rising. Regardless, they both seem to keep rising.
